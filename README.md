# tic-tac-toe

My attempt at creating a tic-tac-toe game based on the project from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/ 

Live preview: https://vancelott.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

Future ideas to implement:

A bot to play against, and a system to keep track of the score. In addition to that, I want to add a separate element to congratulate the winner, instead of an alert.
